# A React project for a webbased tracker to keep track of World of Warcraft characters
A solo project to practice React and Javascript. The idea at the moment is to make something similar to [Raider.io] (https://raider.io/) but keep it much simpler. 


TODO:
- [ ] Currently fetcing data from the Raider.io API I want to try fetching data from the Blizzard API. Check How Oauth works.
- [ ] Fix a login-system with JWT.
- [ ] Add more stuff.
